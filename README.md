Pokedex ForzaLabs

Pokedex ForzaLabs is a small web application built with React, Vite, and MantineUI. It utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokémon and allows users to search for a specific Pokémon and view its characteristics. The app is responsive and dynamically changes colors based on the type of Pokémon (e.g., fire, water, grass).
